# prawn_calendar

Things involved in making this:

- Twint for quickly retrieving past tweets
- Selenium for dynamic web scraping based on those tweets
- Dataframes for organising the data
- Beautiful Soup for dealing with HTML 
- Google sheets API to automate uploading to the project GS
- Dotenv to handle environment variables

Most fun project I've done so far.
